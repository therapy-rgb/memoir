    <root><h1 class="chapter-title">Getting Set Up</h1><p>While it’s important to establish a starting point, the specific starting point is a bit arbitrary. We’re always in the middle of things, so there is always time before the starting point. To take my cafe example, I didn’t begin at the cafe, I was at home, drove here, etc. And even when I arrived, there were some technical elements of this project that I worked on before I began to write fresh material.</p><p>The specific technical work I did was relevant to how Pollen functions, as you have to put a ◊ symbol before indicating a type, for example, a link to a website is indicated by ◊link[]{}. So I figured out how to create a keyboard shortcut for the diamond symbol by typing the letters “los”. I also tinkered with how the links would be displayed. This was all part of <em>getting set up</em>, which I’m using here as a technical term. This is when you get things prepared for something that you plan to do.</p><p>In my work as a <a href="https://marcusberley.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychotherapist</a>, I see all of my clients via telehealth, so getting set up for an appointment includes launching the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/?brand=OZZY&amp;ds_kid=10490390262&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21457145903&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAwNDMBhBfEiwAd7ti1Jy-aAw1HWiUgxDm9pwlhTX6sidiJ-_BvGdDUm-e2sawv5ughTdJLBoCAgEQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome</a> web browser, logging into <a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitwarden</a> to then log into <a href="https://www.simplepractice.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SimplePractice</a>, opening <a href="https://bear.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bear</a> (where I write my initial draft of client progress notes) and getting these applications arranged on my screen in a pre-set configuration, using <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moom</a>. This way, when my client appears on the screen, everything is set up predictably, so that I can easily direct my full attention towards my client. The environment is made ready for the experience.</p></root>
