He still is.</p><p>Marcus lives with his wife Katherine, their daughter Natalie, and their dog Amelia. He spends his free time building websites, obsessing over typography, organizing closets, and trying to find a few minutes to sit with a cup of coffee before the next thing happens.</p><p>His writing has appeared on suburbandadmode.com, which is where most of these entries were first published. He is not on social media in any meaningful way.</p><p>This is his first book, if you can call it that.</p></root>
