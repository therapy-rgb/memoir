◊poem{Baby sleeping
Wife sleeping
I organize my closet
fold old curtains,
cup of joe}

◊poem{It's late at night
or almost time
to feed little Natalie
a bottle
Cool air quiet
I hear you rustle
in your crib}

◊poem{A morning nap
for Natalie,
coffee cup for me
What more do you need
on a late September
Saturday}

◊poem{Moments of respite
in a whirlwind day
Opportunities that
open & close
Fall brings out poems
for those who are ready}

◊poem{3am
& you've asleep
again in your bassinet
my mind not quite settled
I think about the future
wanting to get
everything right
I eat some chocolate
& listen to your gentle
breathing}

◊poem{Natalie sleeps in her crib
I see her on the monitor
Katherine sleeps upstairs
she's wrestling a cold

I'm awake at midnight
messing with a website
obsessed again
by the beauty of typography}

◊poem{I'm mucking around with computers again
staying up late to play games
with words and formats
keystrokes and colors that are
too much more fun than just
the simple lines I make on paper

ode to code}

◊poem{In the car
Natalie sleeping
Drinking my coffee

The mall is for walking babies in strollers while it snows in flurries

For getting out of the house
On cold February days
with nothing but chores and entertainment to pass the time

I'll try on a fitted hat
and let Natalie get her first
glimpse of shopping for stuff that isn't food}

◊poem{morning time
and we all slept through the night
what a wonderful thing I took for granted
all those years without a baby

you only cried out once
then went back to sleep
I drank some water and did the same

I even have time to brush my teeth
before you wake up
ready for a bottle and a diaper change
to start seeing this world
new all over again}
