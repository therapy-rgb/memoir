    <root><h1 class="chapter-title">Meetings</h1><p>So many meetings, sitting down with people, talking about clients, talking about metrics, talking about money. People are people, and we have to schedule, there are plans to be made and followed up on, there are things in the world that need the wheels greased. Some are fun, some all business, sometimes I wish there were no meetings at all.</p><p>But there are meetings, there are always meetings, because people need to come together and share things and bond and connect and clear the air.</p></root>
