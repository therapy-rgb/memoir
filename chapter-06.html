    <root><h1 class="chapter-title">Florida</h1><p>In Florida with my wife and daughter, staying at my in-law’s place in Florida. It’s a two-bedroom condo that looks out over the ocean, which right now is clouded over and threatening to rain. My wife and I are going out to dinner tonight, and her parents will watch our daughter, who is four months old, who they adore. She’s sleeping now, theoretically, or at least she isn’t crying as she lies in her pack n play.</p><p>It’s the last night of Hanukkah, and a few days to go until Christmas. We’ve got both menorah and Christmas tree, and more family coming into town to visit tomorrow. The energy will keep ramping up as we get into the thick of the holiday, but all I want to do is rest and write, and read a book, to sit with a cup of coffee, to spend a bit of time at the beach when the weather is nice. The simple things always come back around.</p><p>I have work throughout the week, cloistering myself into the guest bedroom, piling up books to put my web camera at the right height for telehealth meetings, coming in and out to grab another cup of coffee, another sparkling water, to go to the bathroom, to say hi to my wife and my daughter, to notice this or that small thing happening, and then withdraw, back into my own little world of therapy, where I talk to people as they try to navigate their lives.</p></root>
