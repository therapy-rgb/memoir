    <root><h1 class="chapter-title">Preface</h1><p>This started as a website. A blog, really, about suburban life and fatherhood, called Suburban Dad Mode. I built it because I love to write, and because having a place to put some of my writing felt better than stuffing it in a drawer.</p><p>But somewhere along the way, the writing changed. It became less about the website and more about the writing itself. The entries got more personal. The poems started arriving at odd hours. I found myself writing in stolen moments–while Natalie napped, while Katherine ran errands, while the dishwasher hummed through its cycle.</p><p>What you’re reading is a collection of those moments. Journal entries from the first year of my daughter’s life, written in real time, between bottles and laundry and dog walks and telehealth sessions. There’s no grand narrative here, no arc of transformation. Just a father trying to pay attention.</p><p>The poems came from the same place. Late nights, early mornings, the in-between hours when the house is quiet and your mind hasn’t settled. They’re small and unpolished, which is how they should be. They weren’t written to be published. They were written because I had a few minutes and a feeling.</p><p>I called this collection Methodology because the design squiggle at the top of the page reminds me of the creative process–how things start tangled and knotted, and gradually, if you’re patient, they straighten into something resembling a line. That’s how parenting feels. That’s how writing feels. You start with chaos and you end up somewhere, not necessarily where you planned, but somewhere real.</p></root>
