    <root><h1 class="chapter-title">Getting Started</h1><p>Getting started can be the hardest part. It takes energy, takes a decision. You don’t know where you’re going, or how long it will take, or if it’s something possible. You just have an inkling. And that has to be enough.</p><p>I’ve wanted to add a journal feature to this website for a little while now, because sometimes I have a little poem, and sometimes my thoughts are more meandering, or I want to explore a topic in longer form. Not sure who I think will read this, but I do love to write, and having a place to put some of my writing is appealing, otherwise it’s just little scribbles of things in various journals, stuffed in a drawer.</p><p>You only need a moment. This morning, after walking the dog (Amelia), getting breakfast, feeding Natalie, changing her diaper, giving Amelia a bath, washing bottles, running the dishwasher, running a load of laundry, and trying to learn what type of wood stain to order for the backyard fence, with Natalie asleep in her swinging chair and Katherine off to pick up wine for tonight’s dinner and get a haircut, I found a moment. It’s true, I could already be napping. But I’m happy to take this moment and put some of my existence into words, to reflect on my little Saturday morning, before I put the laundry in the dryer, before Natalie wakes up, before I see about a nap of my own.</p></root>
