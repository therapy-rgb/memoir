While it's important to establish a starting point, the specific starting point is a bit arbitrary. We're always in the middle of things, so there is always time before the starting point. To take my cafe example, I didn't begin at the cafe, I was at home, drove here, etc. And even when I arrived, there were some technical elements of this project that I worked on before I began to write fresh material.

The specific technical work I did was relevant to how Pollen functions, as you have to put a ◊"◊" symbol before indicating a type, for example, a link to a website is indicated by ◊"◊link[]{}". So I figured out how to create a keyboard shortcut for the diamond symbol by typing the letters "los". I also tinkered with how the links would be displayed. This was all part of ◊emphasis{getting set up}, which I'm using here as a technical term. This is when you get things prepared for something that you plan to do. 

In my work as a ◊link["https://marcusberley.com"]{psychotherapist}, I see all of my clients via telehealth, so getting set up for an appointment includes launching the ◊link["https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/?brand=OZZY&ds_kid=10490390262&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21457145903&gclid=CjwKCAiAwNDMBhBfEiwAd7ti1Jy-aAw1HWiUgxDm9pwlhTX6sidiJ-_BvGdDUm-e2sawv5ughTdJLBoCAgEQAvD_BwE"]{Chrome} web browser, logging into ◊link["https://bitwarden.com"]{Bitwarden} to then log into ◊link["https://www.simplepractice.com"]{SimplePractice}, opening ◊link["https://bear.app"]{Bear} (where I write my initial draft of client progress notes) and getting these applications arranged on my screen in a pre-set configuration, using ◊link["https://manytricks.com/moom/"]{Moom}. This way, when my client appears on the screen, everything is set up predictably, so that I can easily direct my full attention towards my client. The environment is made ready for the experience.
