    <root><h1 class="chapter-title">Notes</h1><p>This book was made with Pollen, a publishing system built on the Racket programming language by Matthew Butterick. Pollen treats a book as a program–the text is the source code, and the output is whatever you want it to be. In this case, HTML. If you’re curious about Pollen or Racket, Butterick’s own book, Practical Typography, is the best place to start. It’s also a Pollen project, and it’s free to read online at practicaltypography.com.</p><p>The typographic choices here follow Butterick’s guidelines closely. Body text is set in Georgia at 22 pixels, with a line height of 1.5 and a measure of about 65 characters per line. Chapter titles and headings use Cooper, a warm slab serif with more personality than it probably should have. The poems are set in TT Disruptors, a handwritten typeface that looks like someone wrote them in a hurry, which is mostly accurate.</p><p>The illustration on the title page is The Design Squiggle by Damien Newman. It represents the design process–starting with uncertainty and mess on the left, gradually resolving into clarity on the right. It felt right for a book about the first year of fatherhood, which follows roughly the same trajectory, though with more diapers.</p><p>The source files live in a private repository on GitHub. There is no build pipeline, no content management system, no deployment infrastructure. You run a command, and the book appears in your browser. It’s the simplest publishing stack I’ve ever used, which is saying something, because I also built a website with Next.js.</p><p>The background color is #fffff8, which is not quite white. Butterick calls it “paper white.” It’s easier on the eyes than a screen full of pure white, and it makes the text feel more like a page than a screen. Small things matter.</p></root>
