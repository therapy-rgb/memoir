Marcus Berley is a licensed mental health counselor, writer, and father living in Rhode Island. He has been in private practice since 2012, specializing in helping people navigate major life transitions -- particularly divorce and separation.

Before all of that, he was a person who liked to write. He still is.

Marcus lives with his wife Katherine, their daughter Natalie, and their dog Amelia. He spends his free time building websites, obsessing over typography, organizing closets, and trying to find a few minutes to sit with a cup of coffee before the next thing happens.

His writing has appeared on suburbandadmode.com, which is where most of these entries were first published. He is not on social media in any meaningful way.

This is his first book, if you can call it that.
