For the last few weeks, I've been spending a lot of my free solo time with Claude Code, working and playing with this website and my business website---marcusberley.com. It's been way too much fun, and I've learned a lot about how to communicate effectively with the AI, and how to use my computers, and how websites function. Because while it's vibe-coding, I've been going over this thing again and again, figuring out security protocols and APIs and aesthetic CSS layouts, and how to use Sanity and local dev servers and /commands. I'm nerding out here, but it's been a real blast.

And while I'm sure I'll still have plenty of technical tinkering to do, there isn't much more set-up or formatting or infrastructure or code analysis to do at this stage. Things are set up, things are stable, things are working. Now, I turn my attention back to writing.

Doing things day-after-day makes a huge difference in quality. You get more comfortable in that particular domain. You get better more quickly. You develop muscle memory. That's way so many people talk so much about the costs of context switching. When you pop in here and pop out over there, it costs you energy. You lose focus, lose depth. And sometimes you have to do a lot of different things, but not all the time. It just becomes a habitual choice.

So I choose to write. Why else get this website all set up, if not for self-expression?
